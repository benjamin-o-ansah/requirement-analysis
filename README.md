# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository focuses on the Requirement Analysis phase of software development, a critical step in understanding what a system must accomplish before design and implementation begin.
It provides insights, documentation, and examples that illustrate how to gather, analyze, and define both functional and non-functional requirements effectively.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate best practices in requirement elicitation, specification, and validation to ensure that the final software product meets user and business needs accurately.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), ensuring that the software being built aligns with business goals, user needs, and technical constraints.

During this phase, developers, analysts, and stakeholders work collaboratively to gather information about what the system should do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements). Techniques such as interviews, surveys, use cases, and workflow analysis are often used to extract clear and measurable requirements.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in the SDLC

1. **Establishes a Clear Project Scope:**  
   Defines the project boundaries and prevents scope creep by outlining what will and will not be included in the software solution.
2. **Improves Communication:**  
   By documenting requirements clearly, all stakeholders, from developers to clients, share a common understanding of system objectives.
3. **Reduces Development Costs and Errors:**  
   Early identification of requirements minimizes misunderstandings and costly changes during later stages of development.
4. **Ensures Quality and User Satisfaction:**  
   Well-analyzed requirements help developers create software that meets user expectations, resulting in a product that is both functional and reliable.
5. **Provides a Basis for Design and Testing:**  
   The requirements document acts as a reference point for system design, architecture decisions, and test case creation.

In essence, requirement analysis bridges the gap between stakeholder expectations and the technical realization of a software product. A well-executed analysis leads to successful project outcomes, higher efficiency, and software that delivers real business value.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a vital phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it lays the groundwork for all design and development efforts that follow. Without a thorough understanding of system requirements, the likelihood of project failure increases significantly. Below are three key reasons why it is critical:

1. **Prevents Miscommunication and Ambiguity:**  
   By clearly defining requirements, all team members and stakeholders share a mutual understanding of what the software should achieve. This helps eliminate confusion and ensures that everyone works toward the same objectives.

2. **Enhances Project Planning and Estimation:**  
   Detailed and well-documented requirements allow project managers to plan more effectively, allocate resources properly, and estimate timelines and budgets accurately. This reduces project risks and improves efficiency.

3. **Improves Product Quality and Customer Satisfaction:**  
   When user needs are thoroughly analyzed and understood, the final product aligns closely with expectations. This leads to higher satisfaction, fewer revisions, and a stronger reputation for quality.

In summary, requirement analysis is not just a preliminary step but a strategic process that determines the success or failure of a software project. It ensures alignment between business objectives, user needs, and technical implementation.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several key activities that ensure the project team fully understands and documents what needs to be built. The following are the five main activities carried out during this phase:

- **Requirement Gathering:**  
  This activity involves collecting information from all stakeholders to understand their needs, expectations, and challenges. Common methods include interviews, questionnaires, observation, and document analysis.

- **Requirement Elicitation:**  
  Elicitation focuses on extracting specific requirements from stakeholders through structured techniques such as brainstorming sessions, focus groups, and prototyping. It helps uncover hidden or implied needs that may not be immediately obvious.

- **Requirement Documentation:**  
  After gathering and eliciting requirements, the information is documented clearly and systematically. This may include creating Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, or use case diagrams to provide a detailed description of system behavior.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:**  
  This step involves examining and organizing the collected requirements to ensure they are consistent, complete, and feasible. Models such as data flow diagrams (DFDs), entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs), or UML models are often used to visualize and analyze requirements.

- **Requirement Validation:**  
  The final activity ensures that the documented requirements accurately reflect user needs and project objectives. Validation helps detect inconsistencies, ambiguities, or missing details before development begins. It is often achieved through stakeholder reviews, walkthroughs, or prototyping.

Together, these activities form the backbone of effective requirement analysis and contribute significantly to building reliable and user-focused software systems.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define what the system must do. They describe the specific behaviors or functions that the booking management solution must support.

**Examples for the booking management project (based on the hotel booking app case study for the Airbnb):**

- Users must be able to search for available hotels based on location, date, number of guests, and filter by amenities.  
- The system must allow users to book a hotel or room and complete the booking workflow including payment.  
- Hotel managers must be able to add or update hotel listings such as room types, availability, and pricing.  
- The system must generate booking confirmations and send notifications by email or in-app to both the user and the hotel manager.  

### Nonfunctional Requirements

Nonfunctional requirements describe how the system performs its functions. They define the operational qualities that the system must possess such as performance, security, usability, reliability, and scalability.

**Examples for the booking management project:**

- The system should respond to a hotel search request within two seconds even under moderate load to ensure a smooth user experience.  
- The booking database and search services must scale to handle thousands of concurrent users and millions of hotel listings, reflecting a microservices and elastic search architecture.  
- Customer data and payment transactions must be encrypted and processed in compliance with security standards to protect user privacy and prevent fraud.  
- The system must be available at all times with minimal downtime, ensuring 99.9 percent uptime so users can make bookings and hotel managers can update listings when needed.

## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are graphical representations of a system’s functionality that illustrate how various users (called actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals. They depict the relationships between the actors and the different use cases, 
representing system behavior from a user’s point of view.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

- Simplify system understanding: Provide a clear overview of what the system does and who interacts with it.

- Improve communication: Bridge the gap between non-technical stakeholders and developers.

- Support requirement validation: Help ensure that all required system functionalities are captured.

- Aid in design and testing: Serve as the foundation for developing user scenarios and test cases.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** are a vital component of **Requirement Analysis**, as they define the specific conditions that a software feature must meet to be considered complete, functional, and acceptable to stakeholders. They serve as a shared understanding between developers, testers, and business stakeholders of what “done” means for a particular requirement or user story.

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis

1. **Clarifies Expectations:**  
   Acceptance criteria remove ambiguity by providing clear, measurable conditions that must be fulfilled before a feature can be accepted. This ensures everyone, from developers to product owners, has the same understanding of the feature's functionality.

2. **Guides Development and Testing:**  
   They act as a checklist for developers and QA testers to verify that all required behaviors are correctly implemented and tested before deployment.

3. **Supports User-Centered Design:**  
   Well-defined acceptance criteria are written from the user’s perspective, ensuring that development focuses on delivering value and usability.

4. **Reduces Rework and Miscommunication:**  
   By defining clear success conditions early in the requirement phase, the team can prevent misunderstandings and avoid costly revisions later in the project.

5. **Facilitates Agile Workflows:**  
   In agile environments, acceptance criteria are used to determine when a user story is considered “done,” supporting better sprint planning and progress tracking.

Example: Acceptance Criteria for the “Checkout” Feature

**Feature:** Checkout Process in the Booking Management System

**User Story:**  
As a registered user, I want to securely complete my booking and make a payment so that I can confirm my reservation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

** 1. The system must allow the user to review booking details (dates, location, price, and number of guests) before payment.  
** 2. The user must be able to choose a payment method (credit/debit card, PayPal, or mobile money).  
** 3. Payment information must be validated and processed securely via the integrated payment gateway.  
** 4. Upon successful payment, the system must generate a booking confirmation and send an email or in-app notification to the user.  
** 5. If the payment fails, the system must display an error message and allow the user to retry or select another payment method.  
** 6. The booking record must be stored in the database with a unique booking ID and transaction reference.  
** 7. The system must ensure that room availability is updated immediately after successful payment to prevent overbooking.
