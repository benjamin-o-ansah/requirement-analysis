# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository focuses on the Requirement Analysis phase of software development, a critical step in understanding what a system must accomplish before design and implementation begin.
It provides insights, documentation, and examples that illustrate how to gather, analyze, and define both functional and non-functional requirements effectively.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate best practices in requirement elicitation, specification, and validation to ensure that the final software product meets user and business needs accurately.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), ensuring that the software being built aligns with business goals, user needs, and technical constraints.

During this phase, developers, analysts, and stakeholders work collaboratively to gather information about what the system should do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements). Techniques such as interviews, surveys, use cases, and workflow analysis are often used to extract clear and measurable requirements.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in the SDLC

1. **Establishes a Clear Project Scope:**  
   Defines the project boundaries and prevents scope creep by outlining what will and will not be included in the software solution.
2. **Improves Communication:**  
   By documenting requirements clearly, all stakeholders, from developers to clients, share a common understanding of system objectives.
3. **Reduces Development Costs and Errors:**  
   Early identification of requirements minimizes misunderstandings and costly changes during later stages of development.
4. **Ensures Quality and User Satisfaction:**  
   Well-analyzed requirements help developers create software that meets user expectations, resulting in a product that is both functional and reliable.
5. **Provides a Basis for Design and Testing:**  
   The requirements document acts as a reference point for system design, architecture decisions, and test case creation.

In essence, requirement analysis bridges the gap between stakeholder expectations and the technical realization of a software product. A well-executed analysis leads to successful project outcomes, higher efficiency, and software that delivers real business value.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a vital phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it lays the groundwork for all design and development efforts that follow. Without a thorough understanding of system requirements, the likelihood of project failure increases significantly. Below are three key reasons why it is critical:

1. **Prevents Miscommunication and Ambiguity:**  
   By clearly defining requirements, all team members and stakeholders share a mutual understanding of what the software should achieve. This helps eliminate confusion and ensures that everyone works toward the same objectives.

2. **Enhances Project Planning and Estimation:**  
   Detailed and well-documented requirements allow project managers to plan more effectively, allocate resources properly, and estimate timelines and budgets accurately. This reduces project risks and improves efficiency.

3. **Improves Product Quality and Customer Satisfaction:**  
   When user needs are thoroughly analyzed and understood, the final product aligns closely with expectations. This leads to higher satisfaction, fewer revisions, and a stronger reputation for quality.

In summary, requirement analysis is not just a preliminary step but a strategic process that determines the success or failure of a software project. It ensures alignment between business objectives, user needs, and technical implementation.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several key activities that ensure the project team fully understands and documents what needs to be built. The following are the five main activities carried out during this phase:

- **Requirement Gathering:**  
  This activity involves collecting information from all stakeholders to understand their needs, expectations, and challenges. Common methods include interviews, questionnaires, observation, and document analysis.

- **Requirement Elicitation:**  
  Elicitation focuses on extracting specific requirements from stakeholders through structured techniques such as brainstorming sessions, focus groups, and prototyping. It helps uncover hidden or implied needs that may not be immediately obvious.

- **Requirement Documentation:**  
  After gathering and eliciting requirements, the information is documented clearly and systematically. This may include creating Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, or use case diagrams to provide a detailed description of system behavior.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:**  
  This step involves examining and organizing the collected requirements to ensure they are consistent, complete, and feasible. Models such as data flow diagrams (DFDs), entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs), or UML models are often used to visualize and analyze requirements.

- **Requirement Validation:**  
  The final activity ensures that the documented requirements accurately reflect user needs and project objectives. Validation helps detect inconsistencies, ambiguities, or missing details before development begins. It is often achieved through stakeholder reviews, walkthroughs, or prototyping.

Together, these activities form the backbone of effective requirement analysis and contribute significantly to building reliable and user-focused software systems.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define what the system must do. They describe the specific behaviors or functions that the booking management solution must support.

**Examples for the booking management project (based on the hotel booking app case study for the Airbnb):**

- Users must be able to search for available hotels based on location, date, number of guests, and filter by amenities.  
- The system must allow users to book a hotel or room and complete the booking workflow including payment.  
- Hotel managers must be able to add or update hotel listings such as room types, availability, and pricing.  
- The system must generate booking confirmations and send notifications by email or in-app to both the user and the hotel manager.  

### Nonfunctional Requirements

Nonfunctional requirements describe how the system performs its functions. They define the operational qualities that the system must possess such as performance, security, usability, reliability, and scalability.

**Examples for the booking management project:**

- The system should respond to a hotel search request within two seconds even under moderate load to ensure a smooth user experience.  
- The booking database and search services must scale to handle thousands of concurrent users and millions of hotel listings, reflecting a microservices and elastic search architecture.  
- Customer data and payment transactions must be encrypted and processed in compliance with security standards to protect user privacy and prevent fraud.  
- The system must be available at all times with minimal downtime, ensuring 99.9 percent uptime so users can make bookings and hotel managers can update listings when needed.

## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are graphical representations of a system’s functionality that illustrate how various users (called actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals. They depict the relationships between the actors and the different use cases, 
representing system behavior from a user’s point of view.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

- Simplify system understanding: Provide a clear overview of what the system does and who interacts with it.

- Improve communication: Bridge the gap between non-technical stakeholders and developers.

- Support requirement validation: Help ensure that all required system functionalities are captured.

- Aid in design and testing: Serve as the foundation for developing user scenarios and test cases.
