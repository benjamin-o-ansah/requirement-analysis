# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository focuses on the Requirement Analysis phase of software development, a critical step in understanding what a system must accomplish before design and implementation begin.
It provides insights, documentation, and examples that illustrate how to gather, analyze, and define both functional and non-functional requirements effectively. 
The goal of this project is to demonstrate best practices in requirement elicitation, specification, and validation to ensure that the final software product meets user and business needs accurately.
